              <h2>What is a birth plan?</h2>
              <p>
                A birth plan is a document (usually a page or two long) that lets your medical team know your expectations and preferences while giving birth. It typically includes everything from how you want to manage labor pain to what kind of atmosphere you want in the delivery room.
              </p>

              <p>
                Of course, you can&apos;t control every aspect of labor and delivery, and you&apos;ll need to be flexible if something comes up that requires your birth team to depart from your plan. (And if you want to change things up in the moment, that&apos;s fine too.) A healthy mom and baby are the most important parts of the process.

                &quot;Remember that the plan is a &apos;Plan A,&apos;&quot; says Shannon Smith, M.D., an ob-gyn at Brigham Faulkner Ob/Gyn Associates in Boston and member of the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board. &quot;Unfortunately, for labor and delivery not everyone gets plan A, so keeping an open mind is a must.&quot;

              Most hospitals and birth centers provide a birth plan template or brochure to explain their policies and philosophy of childbirth, and to let you know which options are available. That information can be helpful in guiding you and your provider in a discussion about your preferences.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need to make a birth plan?</h2>
            <p className='intro-text'>
              Birth plans aren&apos;t required, but they&apos;re nice to have, especially if you have specific desires and want a place to make your wishes clear. Plus, the process of making a birth plan may help you get more comfortable with and prepared for having your baby.

              Going over your plan with your doctor or midwife well ahead of time will also help you iron out any questions you have and avoid disappointment later. You might learn that your hospital doesn&apos;t allow filming of births, for example, or that you can&apos;t have as many people as you&apos;d like in the delivery room.
